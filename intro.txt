web development and web programming mean the same thing.
 web apps are any web program, like a browser or wordpress or anything like that.

client vs server computers. 
 software is the only real difference. sewrver computers have server software to handle client requests and server responses known as the request/response cycle.
   server is the app that sends out responses

WYSIWYG 
 I didnt know what this was once when i saw it in a job listing on indeed. but of course, i googled it right away. its a code editor that lets you see the changes or progress youre maing in real time. basically as if viewing it on a localhost or if you wrote some JS to make trhe browser refresh at a set interval.

wordpress
 a CMS
 i know theres two different branches of wordpress. one where you can make say, a blog or something, and one where you can actually build a site with themes and plugins and things. the latter is the big one that we will most likely be hearing about here.

 he covered both wordpress.com (the basic) and wordpress.org (self hosted)
 other CMS options are joomla and drupal, which i have heard of, but wasnt totally sure what they were.

Websites vs. Web apps
 web apps are just websites that are also apps. any website with a database is a web app. web apps will have content that changes (dynamic content). 

target=""
 in <a> tags, the target can be somethiong individual, like the name of the site youre sending them to. for instance, <a target="_google" href="http://www.google.com">Go to google in a new tab</a>
