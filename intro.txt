web development and web programming mean the same thing.
 web apps are any web program, like a browser or wordpress or anything like that.

client vs server computers. 
 software is the only real difference. sewrver computers have server software to handle client requests and server responses known as the request/response cycle.
   server is the app that sends out responses

TLD == Top Level Domain 
 meaning the extension  
  .com .net .ca .pizza .jobs

WYSIWYG 
 I didnt know what this was once when i saw it in a job listing on indeed. but of course, i googled it right away. its a code editor that lets you see the changes or progress youre maing in real time. basically as if viewing it on a localhost or if you wrote some JS to make trhe browser refresh at a set interval.

wordpress
 a CMS
 i know theres two different branches of wordpress. one where you can make say, a blog or something, and one where you can actually build a site with themes and plugins and things. the latter is the big one that we will most likely be hearing about here.

 he covered both wordpress.com (the basic) and wordpress.org (self hosted)
 other CMS options are joomla and drupal, which i have heard of, but wasnt totally sure what they were.

Websites vs. Web apps
 web apps are just websites that are also apps. any website with a database is a web app. web apps will have content that changes (dynamic content). 

target=""
 in <a> tags, the target can be somethiong individual, like the name of the site youre sending them to. for instance, <a target="_google" href="http://www.google.com">Go to google in a new tab</a>

jpeg
 use jpeg for real life photos
 HD

png
 use png for immages that have solid lines like ilustrations or icons
 png (accordint to mischook) is the most advanced image format
 Also HD but not as good for photos
 best for transparency and grading/fading/blending
 Larger file size for photos

gif
 not HD
 tiny file size
 great for animations and small icons

<span>
 the span tag is an inline element whereas div is block Level

query string
 all additional information that gets passed into the url is called a query string.

<meta name=""
 the ones youll see on every web page are:
 charset, description, keywords, author, viewport
   There are many more you could add but theyre less common

CSS selector prioritization
 CSS doesnt just go with whatever declaration was set last, but will plaace more importance on an elements id styling.
 an elements individual id styling is prioritized over class or html selectors.

CSS specificity
 css selectors that are more specific will take precedence over less specific ones


CSS selectors
 p .italic vs p.italic
  if using p.italic, that means any paragraph element with class italic, but...
    p .italic
     this here means any element within a p tag that has a class of italic.
  so the space in between selectors means the first one is the parent and the second selector must be a child to that parent.

  there is also of course the comma seperating selectors which just means anything in this list must be styled like so.

Font Families with multiple words must have quotes around them.

CSS %
 if you set a tags height as a percentage, the containing tag must have its height  set in pixels. 

 AS IN:
 it will not just base that percentage off the page size or window size.

Link styling
 Love & Hate
 L  link
 V  visited
 H  hover
 A  active

background position
 instead of clockwise shorthand like other things, the properties are 
   horizontal then vertical

clear:
 clears this element past any  floated elements.
 so if you have an image floating in a page with text around it, the text will avoid or respect the image, but if you use clear on the text, it will get out of the way entirely, past any floated elements. so that theres no test near the picture at all.

position: static;
 anything with the default position of static, can not use top: bottom: left: or right: properties. only if position is fixed, relative, or absolute.
   he didnt cover position sticky

position: fixed;
 always adjusts its self according to the main viewport.

position: relative;
 always adjusts its self according to where it was to begin with.
   it will also scroll with the page.

position: absolute;
 an element that is positioned  absolutely, is adjusted according to the position of its nearest ancestor or parent that is not static. Usually its inside a tag that has its position set to relative, but fixed is also fine.

<main>
 internet explorer (although gone since windows 10)
 does not support the main tag, so for safetys sake, one should still use an aria role of main and display: block;

<nav>
 just like main, older browsers wont recognize them as tags of their own, so using display block and an aria role would be best practice

specificity
 remember the rule of specificity when doing media queries. specificity is prioritized over cascade order

background-attatchment: fixed;
 this creates the super cool window effect 

display: table or table-cell;
 simulates a tabular style layout without the confusion when it comes to accessibility
